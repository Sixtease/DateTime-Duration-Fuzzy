Revision history for DateTime-TimeAgo

0.06    2012-04-20 16:43
        Fixed a bug where yesterday but less than 24 hours ago
        would be evaluated to 'this evening or some such'.
        Thanks to Ben Rogers (bdr.org) for bug report.

        Removed 'use integer' as it makes high number operations
        fail on 32bit systems. Enable the ARCH_64BIT environmental
        variable to 'use integer' (which adds to performance).

        No longer relying on DT::Duration->in_units method.
        Added 'several months ago' and 'about a year ago'.
        Removed 'this year'.

        Renamed to DateTime::Duration::Fuzzy.
        Now creating DateTime objects with the from_epoch method.
        Fixed some typos.
        thanks to moritz the perlmonk
