        No longer relying on DT::Duration->in_units method.
        Added 'several months ago' and 'about a year ago'.
        Removed 'this year'.

        Renamed to DateTime::Duration::Fuzzy.
        Now creating DateTime objects with the from_epoch method.
        Fixed some typos.
        thanks to moritz the perlmonk
